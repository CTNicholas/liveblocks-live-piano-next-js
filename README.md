## [Try it out](https://livepiano.ctnicholas.dev)

There are 10 different instruments to choose from. To play the piano, tap/click the keys on the screen or use your computer's keyboard.

- Install all dependencies with `npm install`

- Create an account on [liveblocks.io](https://liveblocks.io/dashboard)

- Copy your secret key from the [administration](https://liveblocks.io/dashboard/apikeys)

- Create a file named `.env.local` and add your Liveblocks secret as environment variable `LIVEBLOCKS_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_yourkey`

### Run examples on CodeSandbox

- Open this repository on CodeSandbox with this [link](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/liveblocks/liveblocks/tree/main/examples/nextjs-live-avatars)

- Create an account on [liveblocks.io](https://liveblocks.io/dashboard)

- Copy your secret key from the [administration](https://liveblocks.io/dashboard/apikeys)

- Create [secret](https://codesandbox.io/docs/secrets) named `LIVEBLOCKS_SECRET_KEY` with the secret key you just copied. You need to create an account on CodeSandbox to add an environment variable.
